# openaim
Another one of my computer vision side projects

TODO: add a requirement file, basically OpenCV, GDK, Numpy, Matplotlib, pyautogui



Finds a face or faces and goes through them. The basic idea was an aimbot for FPS games that NOT based on the illegal grabbing of the coordinates of the heads of players/npcs in a game through hooking programs. You can get it and expand with a clicker library for automation of GUI/testing so as to really make a triggerbot.. or maybe I will add it in the future..
